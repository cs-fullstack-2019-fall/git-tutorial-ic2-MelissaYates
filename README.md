### WELCOME TO CODE SCHOOL
 
Our Code School is a hands-on class designed to train individuals to be entry-level software developers within a six-month course. The minimum education requirement is at least a high school diploma or GED. Students work in a small classroom setting and use real-word technologies to learn the fundamentals of coding, app development, the leadership, and the life skills needed for a successful career and job market competitiveness.
I wanted to come to Code School because I wanted to make a change in my career path. I am absolutely loving the process (at first this was not the case as I didn't know what to do at first). I am so glad I got in and that I am getting the help I need to develop my abilities as well as help others when I am through.
